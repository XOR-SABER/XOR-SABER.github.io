            <p>A Markov Chain is a type of graph in which each vertex represents a word, and
            the edges (directed and weighted) coming out of each vertex indicate how often
            the other word came from that word. We load the graph using data from a corpus
            of text, and the graph we get at the end of it can be used to generate new
            sentences in the style of whatever we trained it with.</p>

            <p>10. Generate lyrics using probablity</p>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character" >://Part 1 - Loading Data</h2>
            <p>You need to build a graph (I created a couple sample classes and data
            structures for you, but you can discard them if you are feeling lucky) using
            the data loaded from disk. You&#39;ll load one line at a time from the file using
            getline (or readline if you like my read library) and then read one word at a
            time from that line. The first word needs to be noted that it was the first
            word in a sentence, so that you have a starting point for generating random
            sentences. You can also record if it ends a line, if you like, though it&#39;s not
            necessary.</p>
            <p>Then as you read one word at a time in from the line, every word that follows
            another word creates an edge between them with weight 1 (if there was no edge
            before) or increases the existing edge weight by one if it is a duplicate.</p>
            <p>Uppercaseify all inputs, so Tomato and TOMATO and tomato are the same.</p>
            <h3 >For example:</h3>
            <p>APPLE TOMATO</p>
            <p>Apple TOMATO</p>
            <p>TOMATO APPLE</p>
            <p>TOMATO PEACH</p>
            <h4 >Will create a graph that looks like this:</h4>
            <pre>
    2          1
    APPLE --> TOMATO --> PEACH
        1
        <--
            </pre>
            <p>APPLE started two lines, TOMATO started two lines. TOMATO ended two lines,
            APPLE ended one line, PEACH ended one line. </p>
            <p>And finally prining the graph to the screen</p>
            <img class="img-fluid d-lg" src="/imgs/projects/markov/img2print.png"></img>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 2 - Generating Random Sentences</h2>
            <p>So let&#39;s say you&#39;re ready to generate a random sentence. There were 4 lines in
            the input file, so you will do a &quot;int roll = rand() % 4&quot; to get a number from
            0 to 3. You then will go through each vertex in the graph (in the order they
            were entered, DON&#39;T MESS WITH THE ORDERING) and subtract off the start_count
            of each vertex. If the roll is then negative, that&#39;s your start. For example,
            say you rolled a 2.
            The first element in the graph is APPLE, APPLE has a start_count of 2, so the
            roll is reduced by 2 to 0. 0 is not negative, so we keep going. We get to
            TOMATO next, which also has a start count of 2, so we subtract off 2 from
            roll, giving us -2. This means that TOMATO is the start of the sentence.</p>
            <p>Cool. So we output &quot;Tomato&quot; to the screen.</p>
            <p>Next, we need to figure out what word comes next. Tomato appeared 4 times in
            the input, 2 times as the end of a sentence (50% chance), and 2 times leading
            to other words (25% chance of APPLE, 25% chance of PEACH). So let&#39;s say we
            roll another die, modulus the number of times TOMATO appears (4), and we get a 3.
            We subtract off the number of times it ends a sentence, and the roll is now 1.
            We subtract off the number of times APPLE follows from TOMATO, and we now
            have 0. This is still not negative, so we continue. We subtract 1 off for
            PEACH (since PEACH comes from TOMATO one time) and it goes negative, and so
            PEACH is our next node in the graph. </p>
            <p>Cool. So we output &quot; peach&quot; to the screen, and continue with peach as the
            current node in the graph.</p>
            <p>PEACH appears one time in the graph, and so we roll rand() % 1, giving us
            zero. We start by subtracting the number of times PEACH ended a sentence (1),
            giving us a negative number. So that&#39;s our choice. We output &quot;.\n&quot; and are
            done with this sentence.</p>
            <p>Move on to the next sentence, and you&#39;ll all done.</p>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 3 - Generate a cache file for quick data storage</h2>
            <p>The whole point of generating these cache files is to minimize the time needed to
            use the data, it ususaly faster to use data that is already formated and ready to be inserted
            into the graph than creating new data</p>

            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 4 - Generate stats for the graph</h2>
            <p>The whole goal of this function of the program is to show and describe the graph:</p>
            <p>1. The word with the most weight</p>
            <p>2. The most common beginning word</p>
            <p>3. The most common ending word</p>
            <p>4. the most common word</p>
            <p>5. the most common edge word</p>
            <img class="img-fluid d-lg" src="/imgs/projects/markov/img4stats.png"></img>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 5 - Implement using object oriented programming</h2>
            <p>I personally have nothing to show for my CSCI-41, class which is the class where you learn how to 
            use object oriented programming. I ended up refactoring this code to use that methodology. Using separate .cc files and object files and a makefile to complie the program. </p>
            <img class="img-fluid d-lg" src="/imgs/projects/markov/img5code.png"></img>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 6- Implement operator overloading</h2>
            <p>C++ has the special ablity to overload certain operators
            for this project in particular, I imagine overloading the 
            &lt;&lt; operator would help with the printing, and show a use for it.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid d-lg" src="/imgs/projects/markov/img6code.png"></img>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 7- use #include &quot;filesystem&quot;</h2>
            <p>using filesystem which isn&#39;t covered in any of the computer science classes, 
            plus a nifty looking file explorer would be cool to implement. </p>
            <img class="img-fluid d-lg" src="/imgs/projects/markov/img7files.png"></img>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 8 - Combine graphs</h2>
            <p>this part came from a issue I had with not being able to combine graphs for easy use, so I can get bigger data sets. which is baiscally the same as the contructor for the graph, but I had to use it a private function to 
            be able to use it again for the adding the new graph.</p>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 9 - Use a graph with adjacency lists</h2>
            <p>Using a vector of vertexes, use it like a adjacency list to hold the edges we are connected to. this is a 
            graph theory problem overall, and using this methology would help with the program. </p>
            <img class="img-fluid d-lg" src="/imgs/projects/markov/img9code.png"></img>
            <div style="height: 3em;"></div>
            <h2 class="blink_term_character">://Part 10 - Generate lyrics using probablity</h2>
            <p>we need to figure out what word comes next. Tomato appeared 4 times in
            the input, 2 times as the end of a sentence (50% chance), and 2 times leading
            to other words (25% chance of APPLE, 25% chance of PEACH). So let&#39;s say we
            roll another die, modulus the number of times TOMATO appears (4), and we get a 3.
            We subtract off the number of times it ends a sentence, and the roll is now 1.
            We subtract off the number of times APPLE follows from TOMATO, and we now
            have 0. This is still not negative, so we continue. We subtract 1 off for
            PEACH (since PEACH comes from TOMATO one time) and it goes negative, and so
            PEACH is our next node in the graph. </p>
            <p>thus using the probablity we learned in CSCI-26 as well as the graphs we learned. </p>
            <p>Good luck! Lol.</p>
